# Changelog

Products follow the `stable` channel (or a pinned tag, `team.plugin_ref` in `.product-team/project.yml`): the
first `slot-pm` of the day runs `vendor self-update` and opens a PR with the entries in between. Breaking changes (a renamed label, a changed script contract, a new required
`project.yml` key) are marked **Breaking** with the migration step.

## Unreleased

- **Owner requests to the PM** (geeera/team-console ADR 0005). The team console lets the owner ask the PM to move
  an issue to the current or next sprint or back to the backlog, or up or down the queue; it posts one comment on
  the owner's token whose first line is `<!-- pt-owner-request {"kind":"sprint","target":"next","v":1} -->`
  (`kind` `sprint` → `target` `current` | `next` | `backlog`, or `priority` → `direction` `up` | `down`).
  `backlog requests [--milestone M|current|none] [--days 30]` lists the pending ones; `slot-pm` and `pm` read them
  when they plan, apply each within the caps and the freeze rule or decline it with the reason, and answer every
  one with `backlog request-done N --comment-id ID --result applied|declined [--text …]`, which posts
  `<!-- pt-owner-request-handled {"comment_id":ID,"result":"applied","v":1} -->` as the team's identity (never
  with the owner's token; refused when the agents act as the owner's login; `declined` needs the reason). A
  request is advice, not an owner command: it never approves scope, changes a status or moves work in progress.
- **Who a request counts from.** Only the exact first line with the canonical JSON (sorted keys, no spaces, no
  other fields, `v: 1`) is a marker; the request and handled parsers never match each other's line
  (`scripts/ptlib/ownerrequests.py`, golden fixtures in `tests/fixtures/owner-requests.json`). A request is
  honoured only when the owner wrote it, nobody ever edited it (the owner's own edits included; REST-only:
  `updated_at == created_at`), its `performed_via_github_app.slug` is one of `team.console_app_slugs`, compared
  exactly, and no agent in the session can write as the owner (`gh.acts_as_owner` false — the fallback until
  GitHub is verified to set the app on user-to-server comments). An owner-authored marker without the app (the
  owner's `gh` token, a PAT, an agent holding either) is ignored. The newest honoured request on an issue replaces
  older ones; it is pending until the team's own identity — never the owner's login — posted an unedited handled
  marker for its `comment_id` after it. Requests older than `--days` are ignored ("older than the lookback"); one
  run reads at most 25 issues with requests (owner-written console requests first, then the newest), and reports the rest under `truncated`. Every marker
  that does not count is listed under `ignored` with the reason. Works without GraphQL.
- New optional `project.yml` key `team.console_app_slugs` (app slugs, not `[bot]` logins; an unreadable list is
  an error). It is the trust root for requests, so it is read from the repository's **default branch** through
  the API, never from the working tree (`project.text_on_branch`, now shared with `pr gate`'s base-branch read).
  `backlog comment` refuses a body that starts with either marker.
  **Migration** (only for products that use the team console): add `console_app_slugs: [team-console-<env>]`
  under `team:` for each console environment that writes to the repository, through a PR to the default branch.
  Without it no request is honoured and `backlog requests` says why.

## 0.10.3

- **Fix: scheduled runs work without GitHub's GraphQL API** (every team-console cloud routine since 0.10.1 ended
  with `runlog start` → `unverified`: Claude Code cloud sessions answer `POST /graphql` with HTTP 403 "GitHub
  GraphQL is not available from Claude Code sessions; use the REST API", and the scripts read edit history there).
  `ptlib/gh.graphql` recognises that 403 (`gh.GraphqlUnavailable`), remembers it for the process and stops
  asking; every reader of edit history (`runlog`, `backlog answers`/`reversals`/`decide`/`vanished`, `brief`,
  `demo-page decisions`) then runs in **REST-only mode**: a comment counts only when REST shows it was never
  edited (`updated_at` exactly equals `created_at` — the former two-second slack is gone, with or without
  GraphQL, since an edit made within it would have counted), every edited one is untrusted — whoever edited it,
  the owner included — and an issue body is never an owner statement (`body.owner_statement: false`, `body:
  null`, with the reason; REST cannot clear a body, whatever its timestamps say). The output says `history:
  rest-only` with `history_error`. `runlog start` no longer answers `unverified` (the decision is gone;
  `overlap`/`paused`/`pause`/`proceed` remain).
- **The run log is append-only.** `runlog finish` posts a second comment for the run instead of editing the
  `started` one; `parse_runs` merges the trusted entries of a run id (latest wins, `at` is the start). An entry
  that cannot be trusted (edited, with no edit history to vouch for it, or edited by an outsider) supplies
  nothing: it never creates a run and never changes a run's start, slot or state; it only flags the run of the
  same id it postdates (`trusted: false`), whose effective state is then `unknown` once ended — not a failure,
  and a streak-breaker, so an old edited entry can never pause the team for good — while a run still `started`
  stays in progress (the overlap guard holds). `runlog stats` counts `unknown` runs separately.
  **Migration**: none to do. Logs written before 0.10.3 (e.g. team-console #22) hold in-place-edited entries;
  they still parse and count as before where GraphQL works, and are not runs in cloud sessions (only the
  never-edited entries are — a run that died on the usage limit counts as failed, as always, so a log whose
  last three unedited entries are dead runs pauses once; `/resume` lifts it). `brief mark` is append-only too
  (one marker per conversation, the latest counts).
- `inbox update` pins the "Needs you" issue best-effort: without GraphQL it warns on stderr, reports
  `pinned: false` and the run goes on (the issue is found by its label).
- `backlog vanished` and `backlog answers` report `history` (`graphql` | `rest-only`); an edited owner command is
  rejected with "write the command again in a new comment" appended to the reason.
- `reference/identities.md` and `reference/run-protocol.md` describe the cloud constraint and the REST-only rule.

## 0.10.2

- **Proportional reviews.** A new `review:` block in `.product-team/project.yml` says which verdicts a PR needs:
  `qa` and `reviewer` are `always`, `code` (only when the PR changes a path matching `code_paths`) or `never`;
  `max_rework_rounds` is guidance for orchestrators on rework rounds for non-blockers (reported by `pr gate`, not
  enforced by it). `pr gate` / `pr merge` read the block from the PR's **base** branch (`ref=refs/heads/<base>`),
  like `team.reviewer_logins`, so a PR cannot relax its own gate. `code_paths` globs match case-insensitively,
  ignore a leading `./` and refuse `{a,b}`, `[ab]` and `!negation`; default `code_paths` also cover scripts,
  Terraform, HTML/CSS, Astro/Svelte and build configs. A second `review:` block or key, or an unclosed quote,
  is an error; `#` inside quotes is text. SECURITY is unchanged (`pr
  security-check` decides). `pr gate` now answers `why` (for QA, REVIEW and SECURITY: required or not, and why)
  and `policy`. An unreadable block fails the gate. **No block = the old behaviour** (QA and REVIEW on every PR):
  existing products change only when they add the block. **Migration** (optional): copy the `review:` block from
  `templates/project.yml` and set `code_paths` to the product's source roots; kickoff and adopt now write it
  (`reviewer: code`).
- **Review triage** (`reference/workflow.md` → Review gate; `slot-qa`, `slot-dev`, `qa`, `reviewer`): only a real
  bug, a real vulnerability or an unmet acceptance criterion blocks a merge; everything else is approved and filed
  as a follow-up issue (`kind:finding` / `kind:chore`). After `max_rework_rounds` a PR goes back only for an open
  blocker. `slot-qa` starts only the reviewers `pr gate` requires.
- **Evidence before review**: developers run the real flow end to end (not only unit tests) and paste the evidence
  in the PR body under **How it was verified**; QA treats a behaviour change without it as an unmet criterion.
- **Owner commands are read only from the owner's own prose** (from QA in geeera/team-console): a command counts
  only as the first token of a line (indented by at most three spaces, a tab or NBSPs; a lone `\r` ends a line)
  outside fenced code blocks, inline code, blockquotes and HTML comments. In same-account mode (`gh.acts_as_owner`)
  a comment that starts with a team note header (`**Architect note**`, `**PM grooming**`, … —
  `commands.AGENT_NOTE_ROLES`) or a script marker (`<!-- pt-… -->`) holds no command; with the team app it is
  parsed normally. Every agent now starts its issue comments with its header. `/go-live` is no longer read as
  `/go`. **Breaking** for owners who indent commands four or more spaces or fence/quote them — but never
  silently: `backlog answers` lists every owner comment 0.10.1 would have read a command from and 0.10.2 does not
  under `ignored` with `kind: not_read` and the reason; edited comments there now carry `kind: edited`.
- **Owner commands on pull requests**: the edit-history read (`provenance.fetch`) uses
  `repository.issueOrPullRequest(number:)`, so a PR number is checked like an issue instead of failing; anything
  else still fails closed.
- **HTTP deadline and retry** (`ptlib/gh.py`): every API call has an overall wall-clock deadline, retry included
  (default 90 s, `PT_HTTP_DEADLINE` seconds; a slow trickling answer is cut there, not only a stalled read).
  A `GET` is retried once after a timeout or a 5xx with a short backoff when the deadline leaves room; writes
  (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE — GraphQL included) are never retried.

## 0.10.1

- **Security: edited owner comments no longer count** (geeera/team-console#60). GitHub keeps a comment's author when
  someone else edits its body, so anyone with Issues write — the team app, the review app, a collaborator — could
  turn an old owner comment into `/go`, `/approve` or `/resume` and have it read as the owner's. Owner statements
  (`backlog answers`, `backlog reversals`, `demo-page decisions`, the run log's `/resume`, "done" reports) now count
  only when nobody but the owner ever edited them, checked against GitHub's edit history (GraphQL
  `userContentEdits`, `lastEditedAt` + `editor`). Anything edited by another login, by a deleted account, or with
  more history than can be checked is ignored; when the history cannot be fetched only comments the REST timestamps
  show unedited count.
- `backlog answers` adds `ignored` (owner comments with a command that do not count, and why), `done` (verified
  "done" reports; `slot-pm` reads these instead of any `<!-- pt-owner-done -->` comment), `body` (whether the issue
  body is the owner's own words, and who edited it when) and `history_error`. `backlog show` marks edited comments.
- The run log trusts run entries and pause records only when no one outside the team edited them (a pause record
  holds the routine prompts `resume` re-creates). `runlog start` answers `unverified` (exit 3, do no work) when the
  edit history cannot be read — **Breaking** for custom run protocols: treat `unverified` like `paused`.
- The checked text comes from the same GraphQL read as its edit history (REST body only as the fallback), and a
  comment REST shows edited but GraphQL does not is ignored. An edit GitHub reports without history entries counts
  as unchecked. GitHub Enterprise Server without `fullDatabaseId` is read by comment URL instead of failing.
- Team decisions are dated only by decision comments of the team's logins that nobody else edited (`backlog
  reversals`, `brief`), so another Issues writer cannot bury an owner `/reject` under a newer marker. `backlog
  decide` refuses while such a reversal is open unless given `--handles-reversal <comment_id>`; `backlog comment`
  refuses decision markers. `reversals` entries carry `comment_id`.
- The run log is `team.run_log_issue` in `project.yml` (new key; kickoff/adopt write it), else the single
  `team:run-log` issue the team or owner opened; several candidates → every `runlog` command (and `brief`) refuses.
  **Migration**: add `team.run_log_issue: <number>` to `.product-team/project.yml` (`runlog url` shows it). Rotation
  is documented in `reference/schedule-and-models.md`. `brief` reads only the team's unedited run-log entries.
- Deleted owner commands: `runlog finish --acted ISSUE:COMMENT_ID` records the commands a run acted on; the new
  `backlog vanished [--days 30]` (once per run) lists any that were deleted since. `slot-pm` and `demo-apply` pass
  `--acted`.
- Decision comments count only when they start with the marker. `decide --handles-reversal` writes "Answers your
  /reject: <link>" into the decision, and `brief` lists such answers under `answered_rejects`.
- A labelled run-log issue opened by anyone else, or a pinned `team.run_log_issue` not opened by the team or the
  owner, makes the scripts refuse instead of opening a new log.
- Same-account mode is unchanged: the agents are the owner's login there, so their edits look like the owner's
  (`reference/identities.md`, "does not isolate"), and so is anyone holding the owner's credentials, including the
  team console's owner user token.

## 0.10.0

- **Agents on their own GitHub identities** (`reference/identities.md`): an optional **team app** every script and
  push acts as, and a **review app** only verdicts are posted as. Configure with `PT_TEAM_APP_ID` +
  `PT_TEAM_APP_KEY_FILE` / `PT_TEAM_APP_KEY` (base64 or raw PEM) and the same `PT_REVIEW_APP_*` variables. The app
  JWT is signed with the `openssl` CLI; installation tokens are scoped to the product repository and cached until
  shortly before they expire. `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `gh auth token` and `PT_REVIEW_TOKEN` keep working when
  no app is configured; a half-configured app is an error, never a silent fallback to the owner's token.
- The app JWT is signed with the `openssl` CLI; an inline key reaches openssl through a pipe and never touches the
  disk; `*_KEY_FILE` paths expand `~`. Processes the scripts start (git, openssl, gh) never inherit
  `PT_*_APP_KEY*`, `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` or `PT_REVIEW_TOKEN`.
- `pr gate` / `pr merge`: with the review app configured only its bot's verdicts count; the gate fails when the
  review bot is the team bot (also caught when the two ids are a numeric id and an `Iv…` client id of one app) or
  when `team.reviewer_logins` lists the team bot. `team.reviewer_logins` is read from the PR's base branch, accepts
  `name[bot]` logins (quote them) and rejects anything that is not a GitHub login. The same-account warning appears
  only when it is same-account.
- Owner answers: only the owner's own comments count. With the team app, `backlog answer` (team chat) posts with a
  dedicated `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` of the owner (never `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`/`gh auth`) and refuses without it.
  `same_account` stays true (fail closed) in any session holding a credential that resolves to the owner.
- `pr commit -m … [git commit args]` commits as the team app's bot (nothing is committed if the bot cannot be looked
  up; `--author` is refused); plain `git commit` without the app. `pr push [--branch B]` pushes only `feature/`,
  `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `chore/`, `backmerge/`, `revert/`, `design/` and `docs/` branches, never forced, straight to
  `https://github.com/<repo>.git` as the app: the token only in `GIT_CONFIG_*` env (never argv, `.git/config` or
  output), global/system git config ignored, repository-local `insteadOf`/`pushInsteadOf` rewrites refused. Where
  only a session git proxy reaches GitHub it fails loudly instead of falling back. Plain `git push -u origin B`
  without the app. Developers, designers, devops, `slot-pm` (self-update) and `slot-qa` commit and push through
  them.
- The run log accepts entries from the team bot on a log opened by the owner, so switching keeps its history.
- Migration (optional): create the two apps and set the variables per the owner checklist; add
  `'<product>-review[bot]'` to `team.reviewer_logins`.

## 0.9.3

- Designs are published by `design-pages.yml` (GitHub Actions → Pages) from `docs/design` after a PR is merged;
  designers commit prototypes and wireframes by PR and never push to `gh-pages` (the first team-console run was
  rightly stopped from doing that).

## 0.9.2

Found in the first scheduled run on geeera/team-console.
- Scripts no longer write `__pycache__` into the product repository (cloud sessions flagged it as untracked and
  spent turns deleting it); the vendored copy also carries its own `.gitignore`.
- `backlog edit N --title/--body-file`: grooming can fix an issue's title and criteria in place instead of adding
  comments; a question's answer line is preserved.

## 0.9.1

- `backlog label N -name` removed nothing and failed: argparse read `-name` as an option. Label removal works again
  (it is used by slot-pm, slot-qa and the design flow).
- A missing `--body-file` is a clear error instead of a traceback.
- Decision policy: tasks only the owner can do are `kind:chore` + `needs:owner` (answered "done"), not questions.

## 0.9.0

- **Team chat** (SPEC decision 17): the owner talks to the team in one pinned Claude Code session per product
  instead of GitHub issues. "What's new" gives a briefing of what changed since last time and walks through the
  owner's decisions one at a time; plain answers ("да", "нет, потому что…") are written as the commands the team
  reads, marked as given in the chat; requests for work become issues. `team-chat` skill, `scripts/brief`,
  `backlog answer`. `kickoff` and `adopt` walk the owner through creating the chat; the digest points to it.
- Answers are typed by item: questions and designs take approve/reject, the demo issue go/no-go/override, action
  items (accounts, secrets, local work) only "done" — never an approval. Each answer quotes the owner's words, is
  written on one line (no smuggled commands), and only on an open item waiting for the owner. Scheduled runs never
  call `backlog answer`. The briefing counts runs that died as failed and marks up to the brief the owner heard.

## 0.8.0

- **Decision policy** (`reference/decision-policy.md`): the owner decides only money, scope, release, access,
  legal and design approvals. `backlog create --kind question` requires `--owner-category` and `--ask` (the answer
  line, first in the issue) and refuses anything else; `backlog decide` records a team decision (`team-decided`,
  FYI in the digest, reversible with `/reject`); `backlog ask` fixes existing questions. `slot-pm` re-triages open
  questions and closes the team's own.
- **Daily digest to the phone**: `owner-digest.yml` + `scripts/digest` send the pinned inbox through Telegram or ntfy
  every morning, and at once on demo day. Needed because GitHub never notifies you about comments made with your
  own account — which is how the agents write.
- **Inbox**: answer line per question, "Decided by the team (FYI)", owner language (`owner.language: ru`).
- `backlog reversals`: team decisions the owner answered with `/reject`; `slot-pm` reopens them.
- `scripts/workflows run FILE`. New labels `owner:*`, `team-decided`. Run `backlog init` once; add
  `owner-digest.yml` and one digest channel (owner checklist).
- **Breaking** — `backlog create --kind question` now requires `--owner-category` and `--ask`. Existing questions
  keep working; `slot-pm` adds the answer line to the ones that stay the owner's.

## 0.7.0

- **Pause and resume by asking.** `pause` (the owner says "pause development") switches off this repository's
  routines and scheduled workflows (e.g. Renovate), labels the run log `team:paused` and records exactly what was
  switched off; `resume` ("продолжим") switches that back on, re-creates a routine deleted meanwhile, proposes a
  new sprint when every sprint is in the past, and lifts the pause. Routines are disabled, not deleted — the API
  cannot delete them, and disabled routines use no quota.
- `runlog pause | pause-record | resume`, `scripts/workflows list | disable | enable`.

## 0.6.0

Fixes from the storify security review (geeera/storify#89–#92) and two REVIEW findings.

- **Self-update is verified against git, not trusted.** `pr merge --ci-only` on a `chore/product-team-*` PR fetches
  the PR head (it must equal the sha being merged), diffs its tree from the merge base, fetches the plugin commit
  named in the manifest, reads the version from that release's `plugin.json`, requires the tag `v<version>` to
  point at it, requires it to be newer than the installed version (and equal to a pinned `plugin_ref`), and then
  requires every changed path to be a regular file with exactly the release's blob and mode. Files only the old
  install had may only be deleted; `.claude/settings*.json` anywhere is never accepted. Branch operations also
  require the head branch to live in this repository.
- **`security-check` covers agent tooling and gate config**: any `.claude/` directory, `.product-team/project.yml`,
  `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEOWNERS`.
- **`reviewer_logins` accepts YAML block lists** (`- login`); a value that cannot be read now fails the gate
  instead of silently accepting every account.
- When the agents' account cannot be identified, the team assumes it is the owner's (same-account mode).
- **Same-account mode is visible**: `backlog answers` and `pr gate` report it, the inbox keeps a "Security setup"
  item, and a release **go** is then taken only from the demo page or a comment older than the run.
- **Reviewer token**: `pr review` posts as `PT_REVIEW_TOKEN` when present; the owner checklist describes the
  reviewing account and a separate cloud environment for `slot-qa`.
- **Untrusted content**: the run protocol and every agent treat issue/PR text, logs and web pages as data.
  `pm` reads the web and so no longer edits files.
- Self-update PRs must be named `chore/product-team-<version>` and contain only generated files; migrations that
  touch anything else go in a separate reviewed PR.

## 0.5.0

- **Tiers**: the architect sizes every approved issue (`tier:light|standard|heavy`) in `slot-pm`; `backlog next`
  sends it to `fullstack-dev-light` (Sonnet 5), `fullstack-dev` (Opus 5.5) or `fullstack-dev-heavy` (Fable 5.1).
  Guard rails in code: default `standard`; no `light` in the burn window or hotfixes; two failed review rounds
  raise the tier; security-labelled work never on Fable; product specialists keep their own model.
- `sprint-metrics` reports planned, shipped and raised issues per tier.
- New labels `tier:light`, `tier:standard`, `tier:heavy`, `review-failed`, `tier-up`. Run `backlog init` once.

## 0.4.0

- **Team**: `ux-designer` and `ui-designer` replace `designer`; new `reviewer` (code quality, Sonnet) and
  `security` (OWASP, threat models, deep audit, Opus); `qa` keeps acceptance, accessibility and polish.
- **Review gate in code**: `pr gate` / `pr merge` require CI plus `QA:` and `REVIEW:` approvals on the current
  head, and `SECURITY:` when `pr security-check` finds sensitive paths, dependency or CI changes, or a `security`
  label. Branch operations and the self-update PR use `pr merge --ci-only`.
- **Product specialists**: `agent:<name>` routes an issue to the project's own `.claude/agents/<name>.md`.
- New label `ux-spec`. Run `backlog init` once in each product.
- **Migration** — if the product has its own `.claude/agents/` files named `ux-designer`, `ui-designer`,
  `reviewer` or `security`, self-update stops and asks the owner (nothing is overwritten); rename them first.
- Optional `team.reviewer_logins` in `project.yml`: with a separate reviewing account, only its verdicts count.
- **Breaking** — `designer` is gone; self-update removes it. Open issues waiting on a design keep working (the
  next `slot-pm` starts them at the UX step).
- `fullstack-dev` runs on Opus 5.5 in every mode; `fullstack-dev-senior` is removed (self-update deletes it from
  products). `backlog next` always names `fullstack-dev`.

## 0.3.0

- **Cloud runs load the team from the product repository.** `scripts/vendor install` copies agents, skills,
  scripts and references into the product's `.claude/`; cloud sessions load project agents and skills from the
  clone but never install plugins listed in `.claude/settings.json`. `vendor self-update` (first `slot-pm` of the
  day) opens a PR when the `stable` channel moves, so products pick up releases by themselves.
- **No `gh` CLI needed.** Scripts talk to the GitHub REST API with `GH_TOKEN`; new `scripts/pr` covers create,
  view, checks, diff, review, update-branch and merge (merge refuses unless CI passes).
- **Breaking** — in products the skills are `/slot-pm`, `/slot-dev`, `/slot-qa` (project skills), not
  `/product-team:…`. Migration: run `vendor install .` in the product, delete the `product-team` entries from its
  `.claude/settings.json`, point each routine at the product repository only with the new command.
- **Breaking** — `templates/claude-settings.json` is gone (it never worked for cloud runs).

## 0.2.0

- `backlog next`: the development plan is code with tests (`scripts/ptlib/picker.py`) — production defects,
  P0/P1 and release blockers first, then QA rework, then sprint work up to the cap; `needs:*`, unapproved
  designs and missing architect notes are skipped with a reason.
- `hotfix` skill: P0/P1 in production goes `hotfix/*` → `main`, independent QA, back-merge to `stage` and
  `dev`; rollback is a PR or a manual deploy of the previous ref.
- `inbox`: one pinned "Needs you" issue, rewritten by every run.
- Run log records duration and per-run metrics; `runlog stats` and `sprint-metrics` feed the demo.
- Templates: `branch-guard.yml` (an issue for the owner when a protected branch moves without a PR),
  `deploy.yml` (per-environment deploy, rollback trigger, smoke check); `reference/deploy-recipes.md`.
- PRs are brought up to date with their base before QA; conflicts in generated files are regenerated.
- New labels: `architect-note`, `qa:changes-requested`, `needs:local`, `needs:owner`, `in-production`,
  `team:inbox`, `team:guard`. Run `backlog init` once in each product to create them.
- The plugin repository has CI: unit tests and static checks of agents, skills and manifests.

## 0.1.0

- First release: role agents, slot skills, backlog adapter, run log, slot context, demo page.
