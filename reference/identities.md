# Identities: the agents on their own GitHub Apps

Out of the box the agents act as the owner's GitHub account (**same-account mode**). That works, but two things
only hold by convention:

- a verdict in the merge gate (`QA:`, `REVIEW:`, `SECURITY:`) is a comment by the same account that wrote the code,
  so the gate cannot tell a reviewer's approval from a developer approving itself;
- an owner command (`/approve`, `/go`, …) is a comment by the owner's account, so an agent could write one.

Two GitHub Apps give the agents identities of their own. GitHub then records who wrote what, and the scripts check it.

## The two apps

| App | Used by | Writes as | What it unlocks |
| --- | ------- | --------- | --------------- |
| **Team app** | every script and every push (`gh.token()`, `pr push`) | `<team-slug>[bot]` | owner commands count only from the owner's login; commits, issues and PRs are visibly the team's; GitHub notifies the owner about the team's comments |
| **Review app** | `pr review` (verdicts) | `<review-slug>[bot]` | `pr gate` / `pr merge` count only verdicts by this bot |

Permissions (repository permissions; everything else "No access"; Metadata read-only is added by GitHub):

| Permission | Team app | Review app |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Contents | Read and write | Read |
| Issues | Read and write | Read and write |
| Pull requests | Read and write | Read and write |
| Workflows | Read and write | — |
| Actions | Read and write | Read |
| Checks | Read | Read |
| Commit statuses | Read | Read |

Workflows write lets the team change `.github/workflows/` by PR; Actions write lets it pause and trigger workflows
(`scripts/workflows`). The scripts use the review app only for review comments today; its Issues write keeps a
reviewer able to comment its findings on the issue.

## Create them (owner, once per product, ~10 minutes)

For each app: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → **New GitHub App**.

1. Name: e.g. `<product>-team` and `<product>-review` (the slug becomes the bot login `<slug>[bot]`). Homepage URL:
   the repository URL.
2. Webhook: untick **Active** — nothing listens for events.
3. Repository permissions: the table above. Where can it be installed: **Only on this account**.
4. Create, note the **App ID** (About section), then **Generate a private key** — a `.pem` file downloads.
5. **Install App** → your account → **Only select repositories** → the product repository. Nothing else: a token
   is scoped to the one repository anyway, but an installation on other repositories is a standing grant.
6. Put the review bot's login in `.product-team/project.yml`, so sessions without the review key still know which
   verdicts count:

   ```yaml
   team:
     reviewer_logins: ['<product>-review[bot]']   # quote it: [bot] is YAML flow syntax
   ```

## Environment contract

| Variable | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| `PT_TEAM_APP_ID` | team app id (numeric) |
| `PT_TEAM_APP_KEY_FILE` **or** `PT_TEAM_APP_KEY` | path to its `.pem` (`~` is expanded), **or** the PEM itself — base64 (one line, for cloud env vars) or raw |
| `PT_REVIEW_APP_ID` | review app id; must be a different app (checked by bot login, so a numeric id and an `Iv…` client id of one app are caught too) |
| `PT_REVIEW_APP_KEY_FILE` **or** `PT_REVIEW_APP_KEY` | as above, for the review app |
| `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` | only in the team-chat session: a fine-grained token of **your** account (this repository, Issues read/write) that `backlog answer` posts your answers with |

Precedence: `gh.token()` uses the team app when `PT_TEAM_APP_ID` is set, otherwise `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`gh auth token` as before. `gh.review_token()` uses the review app, otherwise `PT_REVIEW_TOKEN` (a reviewing machine
account), otherwise none (verdicts go out with the team token). A half-configured app (id without key, bad key, app
not installed) is an error, never a silent fallback to the owner's token. In app mode your answers are posted only
with `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` — never with `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth`, which may be in a session for other
reasons.

The app's JWT is signed with the `openssl` CLI (present in macOS and the cloud images). An inline key never touches
the disk: openssl reads it from a pipe handed to that one process. Installation tokens live an hour; a script mints
one on first use and reuses it until five minutes before it expires. Scripts never print key material or tokens,
and the processes they start (git, openssl, gh) get an environment without `PT_*_APP_KEY*`, `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` and
`PT_REVIEW_TOKEN`.

## Local setup

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/product-team && chmod 700 ~/.config/product-team
mv ~/Downloads/<product>-team.*.pem ~/.config/product-team/<product>-team.pem
chmod 600 ~/.config/product-team/*.pem
export PT_TEAM_APP_ID=123456
export PT_TEAM_APP_KEY_FILE=~/.config/product-team/<product>-team.pem
```

Keep the review key out of your everyday shell; set it only where reviews run. To answer through the team chat,
also `export PT_OWNER_TOKEN=…` (your fine-grained token) in that shell only.

## Cloud setup (claude.ai/code environments)

Environment variables are single-line, so give the key as base64:

```bash
base64 < <product>-team.pem | tr -d '\n'     # paste the output as PT_TEAM_APP_KEY
```

- **Default environment** (routines `slot-pm`, `slot-dev`): `PT_TEAM_APP_ID` + `PT_TEAM_APP_KEY`. No review app, no
  personal token of yours (`PT_OWNER_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`), no `gh auth` as you.
- **`reviewers` environment** (routine `slot-qa`): the team app **and** `PT_REVIEW_APP_ID` + `PT_REVIEW_APP_KEY`.
  Only this environment can post a verdict that counts. No personal token either.
- **Team-chat environment** (if the team chat runs in the cloud): the team app plus `PT_OWNER_TOKEN`. That session
  can write as you, so it reports `same_account: true` (below) — keep it separate from the scheduled environments.

Delete the downloaded `.pem` files once they are stored; rotate a key by generating a new one in the app's
settings and deleting the old one there.

## What changes for the team

- **Owner commands** count only when your login wrote them (`commands.parse`, the demo decisions block, reversals
  of team decisions). A bot comment that quotes you is never read as your answer.
- **`same_account`** (`backlog answers`, the inbox, the gate warning) is true when an agent in the session can write
  as you: the agents' own identity is your account, **or**, in app mode, any personal credential in the session
  (`PT_OWNER_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `gh auth`) resolves to your login. Only a session with none of those
  is false, and only then does the same-run caution in `slot-pm` and `demo-apply` fall away.
- **`backlog answer`** (team chat) posts with `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` and refuses when it is missing or not yours —
  otherwise the answer would be the bot's and would not count.
- **Verdicts**: with the review app configured, `pr gate` counts only `<review-slug>[bot]`; the login list in
  `project.yml` cannot widen that. Without the key in a session it falls back to `team.reviewer_logins`, read from
  the PR's **base branch** (a PR cannot name its own reviewers). The gate fails when the review bot is the team bot or
  when `team.reviewer_logins` lists the team bot.
- **Commits**: `scripts/pr commit -m "…" [git commit args]` runs `git commit` as
  `<slug>[bot] <id+slug[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>`, linked to the bot on GitHub. When the bot cannot be looked
  up it commits nothing; `--author` is refused. Without a team app it is a plain `git commit`.
- **Pushing**: `scripts/pr push [--branch B]` pushes team branches only (`feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `chore/`,
  `backmerge/`, `revert/`, `design/`, `docs/`), never forced, straight to `https://github.com/<repo>.git` as the team
  app:
  - the token reaches git only through `GIT_CONFIG_*` environment variables — not argv, not `.git/config`, not the
    output — and credential helpers are off for the call, so a rejected token fails instead of pushing as you;
  - global and system git config are ignored for the call (`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`):
    that is where a session proxy's `insteadOf` rewrite lives, and a rewritten URL would lose the auth header and
    let the proxy push with its own credentials while the script reported the bot;
  - a repository-local `url.*.insteadOf`/`pushInsteadOf` that matches the URL is refused, and git's own resolution
    of the URL must come back unchanged.

  **Cloud sessions whose network only reaches GitHub through the session's git proxy** cannot push as the app:
  `pr push` then fails loudly — it never falls back to the proxy. Allow `github.com` in the environment's network
  settings. Without a team app `pr push` is a plain `git push -u origin B`.
- Pushes by an app token trigger workflows (unlike Actions' `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so CI runs on the team's PRs as before.
- The run log accepts entries from the log's author and from the team bot, so a log opened before the switch keeps
  its history. The inbox's standing "Security setup" item disappears once no agent can act as you.

## What this does and does not isolate

It does:
- make the author of every comment, review, commit and push visible and checkable — self-approval and imitated owner
  commands stop counting;
- keep your personal token out of the scheduled environments entirely, and flag any session that has one;
- confine a leaked installation token to one repository and one hour.

It does not:
- separate roles **inside one session**. Every agent in a session sees the same environment variables: in the
  `reviewers` environment a developer agent started by `slot-qa` could read the review key and post a verdict, and
  in the team-chat session any agent could use `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` to write as you. Separation is between
  environments, not between subagents (SPEC: identity limits);
- hide the keys from anything else in the session. The scripts strip them from the processes *they* start, but the
  agents' own shell commands, the project's contract commands (`lint`, `test`, `build`), package scripts and
  dependencies they run all inherit the session's environment and can read `PT_*_APP_KEY` and `PT_OWNER_TOKEN`;
- protect the app keys from anyone who can edit the cloud environment or read your machine;
- enforce anything server-side. Rulesets that require the review bot's approval need GitHub Pro or a public
  repository; `branch-guard.yml` still reports changes that reached `dev`, `stage` or `main` without a merged PR.

## Troubleshooting

| Error says | Fix |
| ---------- | --- |
| `openssl` command is not installed | install OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or unset `PT_*_APP_ID` |
| neither a PEM private key nor base64 of one | re-encode with `base64 < key.pem \| tr -d '\n'` |
| openssl could not sign | the file is not the app's RSA private key |
| GitHub rejected the JWT | wrong app id for this key, or the clock is off by more than a minute (`date -u`) |
| is not installed on owner/repo | app settings → Install App → add the repository |
| may not get a token | the installation does not include the repository, or a permission is missing |
| are the same app | `PT_REVIEW_APP_ID` names the team app; create a separate review app |
| an owner answer must be posted with …'s own token in PT_OWNER_TOKEN | set `PT_OWNER_TOKEN` in the team-chat session, or answer on GitHub |
| refusing to push: … rewrites … / git would push to … | remove the repository-local `insteadOf`; in the cloud, allow direct `github.com` access |
| git push as …[bot] … failed | the network cannot reach `github.com` directly, or the app lacks Contents/Workflows write |
