# Workflow: branches, backlog, approvals

Every role and skill follows this. Source: SPEC decisions 1, 4, 5, 14, 16.

## Branches and release

```
feature/<issue>-<slug> ──PR──▶ dev ──cut 2 days before demo──▶ stage ──owner go at demo──▶ main
                                          fix/<issue>-<slug> ──PR──▶ stage (freeze only)
                                                             hotfix/<issue>-<slug> ──PR──▶ main (P0/P1 in production)
```

- Every change arrives as a PR. **Never push directly to `dev`, `stage` or `main`** — private repos on the
  free plan have no branch protection, so this rule is enforced by you, not by GitHub.
- `feature/*` → `dev`: merge only through the **review gate** (`scripts/pr gate`, enforced by `scripts/pr merge`):
  CI green, `QA: APPROVED` from `qa`, `REVIEW: APPROVED` from `reviewer`, and `SECURITY: APPROVED` from
  `security` when `scripts/pr security-check` finds auth, data, payment, upload, secret, dependency or CI changes.
  Every verdict must be on the current head commit. The orchestrator merges (squash) and moves the issue
  `status:qa` → `status:done`; the developer who wrote it never does. Branch operations (stage cut, release,
  back-merges) and the self-update PR merge with `--ci-only`.
- `stage` is cut from `dev` two days before the sprint milestone's due date (the demo). After the cut only
  `fix/*` PRs targeting `stage` are allowed; each fix is back-merged `stage` → `dev` by a PR.
- `stage` → `main` only after the owner answered **go** on the demo page. The merge PR links the demo issue.
- **Hotfix**: a P0/P1 defect live in production (`in-production`) goes `hotfix/*` from `main` → PR to `main`,
  released without waiting for the demo, then back-merged to `stage` and `dev` (the `hotfix` skill). Rolling back
  is also a PR. The owner is told at once and may override.
- **Stay current before review**: a PR that is behind its base or has conflicts is brought up to date by merging
  the base into the PR branch (no force-push) and re-running CI before QA looks at it. Conflicts in generated
  files are resolved by re-running the generator, never by hand.
- **Branch guard**: `templates/workflows/branch-guard.yml` opens a `sev:critical` issue for the owner whenever
  `dev`, `stage` or `main` moves without a merged PR or is force-pushed — the after-the-fact substitute for
  branch protection.
- Deploys happen only from GitHub Actions: `dev` → dev environment, `stage` → stage environment, `main` →
  production. Agents never call provider CLIs or SSH.
- Forge is GitHub. GitLab-hosted projects are local-mode only (the cloud network cannot reach gitlab.com).

## Backlog = GitHub Issues, behind the adapter

Always go through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog` (see the `backlog` skill). Never call `gh issue`
directly from a slot skill — the adapter is what lets another tracker replace GitHub later.

- **Milestone = sprint.** Title `Sprint NN`, due date = demo day. Two-week sprints.
- **Status** (exactly one per issue):
  `status:proposed` → `status:approved` → `status:in-progress` → `status:qa` → `status:done`,
  plus `status:blocked` (waiting for the owner or an external dependency; the reason is the last comment).
- **Kind**: `kind:feature`, `kind:bug`, `kind:chore`, `kind:finding`, `kind:wow`, `kind:question`.
- **Severity** (bugs and findings): `sev:critical`, `sev:high`, `sev:medium`, `sev:low`.
  P0 = `sev:critical`, P1 = `sev:high`.
- **Flags**: `complexity:high` (architect note first), `architect-note` (the note is on the issue),
  `needs-design`, `design:awaiting-approval`, `design:approved`, `qa:changes-requested`, `foundation`,
  `security`, `ux-blocker`, `release-blocker`, `in-production`, `signature-moment`.
- **Tier** (set by the architect; picks the developer's model): `tier:light`, `tier:standard`, `tier:heavy`;
  `review-failed` and `tier-up` record failed review rounds (see `reference/schedule-and-models.md` → Tiers).
- **Agent**: `agent:<name>` sends the issue to a project-specific agent in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (e.g. a
  Flutter developer) instead of `fullstack-dev`. The project owns those agents; `vendor` never touches them.
- **Design stages**: `ux-spec` (the UX spec and wireframe are on the issue) → `design:awaiting-approval` →
  `design:approved`.
- **Needs** (cloud runs never pick these up; they go to the owner's inbox): `needs:local` — needs a local
  machine such as a Mac; `needs:owner` — a payment, an account, a legal or product decision.
- **Team**: `team:inbox` (the owner's pinned to-do list), `team:run-log`, `team:paused`, `team:demo`,
  `team:guard`.

Status labels are prefixed (`status:*`) so they never collide with labels an adopted repository already uses.

## Approvals

| What | Where the owner answers | Default when silent |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Design of a task | Comment `/approve` or `/reject <why>` on the issue (link sent to the phone) | Stays `status:blocked`; **never auto-approved**. Blocks only that task. |
| Scope (which features exist) | Demo page | Proposed features stay `status:proposed` |
| Release go / no-go | Demo page | No-go |
| P0/P1 bug | No approval needed — fixed immediately; in production via `hotfix` | — |
| Any cost (paid plan, upgrade, domain) | Comment `/approve` on the `kind:question` issue | Work that needs it stops |
| Override of a release blocker | Written reason on the demo issue → recorded as a decision | Blocker stands |

Owner commands in issue comments are case-insensitive and must be written by the repository owner
(the repository's `owner.login`); commands from anyone else are ignored.

## Findings and release gates

| Severity | When fixed | Blocks release? |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Security Critical/High, UX blocker (core flow cannot be completed, data loss, a11y blocker) | Current sprint, no approval | **Yes** (`release-blocker`) |
| Medium | Next sprint, listed on the demo page | No |
| Low | Backlog | No |

A blocker found during the freeze makes the release **no-go automatically**. The owner may override with a
written reason; `demo-apply` records it as a decision.

Checks:
- CI on every PR: lint, tests, build, SAST, dependency audit, secret scan, a11y assertions inside e2e.
- QA review against OWASP ASVS/Top 10 for PRs touching auth, data access, payments or user input.
- Designer UX walkthrough of the key flows on `stage` once per sprint.
- Deep audit (security + a11y + performance + debt) once per sprint in the Saturday burn slot.

## Budget: $0

- Only free tiers. Any paid plan, upgrade, add-on or domain needs an explicit owner `/approve`.
- Hitting a free-tier limit stops **that** work: mark the issue `status:blocked`, open a `kind:question`
  issue explaining the limit and the options, continue with other work.
- GitHub Actions minutes (2,000/month on private repos) are budget: `concurrency` with
  `cancel-in-progress` on PR workflows, `paths` filters on expensive suites, no cron workflows without
  approval.
- Agents never see secret values. They reference `secrets.NAME` in workflows and ask the owner to create the
  secret through the owner checklist.
