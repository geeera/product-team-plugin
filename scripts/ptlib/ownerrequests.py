"""Owner requests to the PM (geeera/team-console ADR 0005): "put #N into the next sprint", "move #N up the queue".

The team console posts a request as an issue comment on the owner's own token; the PM honours it at planning time
within the sprint caps and the freeze rule, or declines it, and answers with a handled marker. A request is advice,
never an owner command: its first line is a `<!-- pt-` script marker, so `commands.parse` never reads it.

  request  line 1: <!-- pt-owner-request {"kind":"sprint","target":"next","v":1} -->
  handled  line 1: <!-- pt-owner-request-handled {"comment_id":123,"result":"applied","v":1} -->

Both parsers anchor on the whole first line and accept only the canonical JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace, exactly
the known fields): `<!-- pt-owner-request` is a prefix of `<!-- pt-owner-request-handled`, and a quote in prose or
a shape this version does not know must do nothing.

A request counts only when all of ADR 0005 decision 2 hold — the repository owner wrote it, nobody ever edited it,
and GitHub says one of the console's apps (`team.console_app_slugs`) posted it — and, until GitHub is verified to
set `performed_via_github_app` on user-to-server comments, never in a session where an agent can write as the
owner (`gh.acts_as_owner`). Owner authorship alone proves nothing there: an agent holding the owner's credential
posts as the owner's login.
