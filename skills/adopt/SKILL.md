description: Take over an existing repository — audit architecture, conventions actually in force, tests, CI and debt; write CLAUDE.md and the project contract without overriding the project's conventions; plan a first sprint of audit and blockers only. Use instead of kickoff when the owner hands over an existing codebase.

# Adopt — existing project

**The project's conventions beat the plugin's defaults.** Deviations from the plugin or the owner's baseline are
recorded, not "fixed". Employer-owned code only with the employer's permission — ask the owner if the repository
might be employer-owned and stop if permission is not confirmed.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/workflow.md` and `stack-contract.md` first.

## 1. Preconditions
- The repository is on GitHub (cloud sessions cannot reach gitlab.com). A GitLab project works only in local
  mode — say so and stop unless running locally.
- `main`, `stage`, `dev` exist. If not, devops proposes creating `stage` and `dev` from `main` (the owner
  confirms; this is a branch creation, not a push of changes).

## 2. Audit (parallel, read-only)
Delegate in parallel, each returning a written report:
- `architect`: architecture map (modules, layers, data flow, external services), conventions actually in force
  (naming, structure, error handling, state, API style, test style) with file examples, existing decision
  records and their format, stack and free-tier limits in use.
- `devops`: CI/CD as it is (jobs, triggers, secrets referenced by name, minutes usage), environments and
  deploy path, containerisation, missing contract pieces.
- `qa`: test inventory (unit/integration/e2e, coverage if measurable, flaky tests), security posture (secret
  scan of history, dependency audit, obvious OWASP issues), a11y of key flows if a deployed URL exists.
- `designer` (only if there is a UI): tokens or their absence, component library, Storybook, visual debt.
Also run the owner's `engineering-baseline:conformance-audit` if installed, to record baseline deviations.

## 3. Write the contract (one PR to `dev`, branch `feature/adopt-contract`)
- `CLAUDE.md`: create or extend (never rewrite the owner's content) — commands, structure, conventions in force,
  where decisions live, how the team works here.
- Decision records: **reuse the project's own** folder and format. If none exists, create
  `docs/decisions/` and record "0001 — adopted by the product team" with the audit summary.
- `.product-team/project.yml` (`mode: adopted`, `decisions_dir` = the project's folder).
- `.product-team/owner-checklist.md` — only what is missing.
- `.claude/settings.json` plugin entries (merge, don't overwrite existing settings).
- CI: only add what is missing from the contract (security workflow, `branch-guard.yml`, concurrency, e2e
  hook); never replace working pipelines. A missing deploy becomes a Sprint 01 question with options from
  `reference/deploy-recipes.md`.

## 4. Backlog
- `backlog init`, `backlog sprint create "Sprint 01" <demo day>`.
- Every audit finding → `kind:finding` with severity; blockers get `release-blocker`. Anything only the owner
  or a local machine can do gets `needs:owner` / `needs:local`.
- `scripts/inbox update` so the owner starts with one list.
- First sprint = **audit follow-ups and blockers only, no features**. Existing feature ideas the owner mentions
  become `status:proposed` for the first demo.

## 5. Output
Owner summary: what the project is, conventions recorded, top risks, the first sprint, checklist items, the
routines to create (as in `kickoff` step 6).
