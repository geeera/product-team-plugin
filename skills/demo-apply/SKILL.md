description: Copy the owner's demo decisions into Issues and act on them — approve or reject proposals, record comments, release stage to main on go (or record no-go/override), close the sprint and open the next. Used by slot-pm after a demo; Issues stay the source of truth.

# Demo apply

`B` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog`, `D` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/demo-page`.
Skip entirely if the demo issue already has a `<!-- pt-demo-applied -->` comment.

## 1. Read decisions (first source that has any wins; merge per item, newest wins)
1. Artifact database — when the demo issue records an artifact URL and `ArtifactData` is available: `list` the
   `decisions` collection, save the rows to a file, `D from-db rows.json`.
2. `D decisions <demo issue>` — the owner's latest pasted `/demo-decisions` block.
3. Per-issue commands — `B answers <n>` on each proposal issue and on the demo issue.
Decisions from anyone but the repository owner do not exist, and neither do owner comments someone else edited
(`D decisions` skips them; `B answers` lists them under `ignored` — report those). No decision on an item = leave it
as it is. Every command you apply goes into the run's `runlog finish` as `--acted N:<comment_id>`.

With `same_account: true` (agents act as the owner's account), a release **go** is only taken from the demo
page's artifact database or from a comment the owner wrote before this run started; otherwise ask again.

## 2. Apply
- Proposal `approve` → `B move N approved`, `B milestone N "<next sprint>"`. `reject` → `B close N --reason "rejected at
  demo: <comment>"`. Comment only → add it to the issue.
- Feedback on a shipped item → comment on that issue; if it describes a defect, `B create --kind bug` with the
  severity `pm` assigns.
- **Release**:
  - `go` with no open `release-blocker` → `devops` opens PR `stage` → `main` (`Release <sprint>`), merge on green
    CI with `scripts/pr merge N --method merge --ci-only`; `scribe` writes the changelog/release notes; tag `v<date>` or the project's scheme.
  - `go` while a blocker is open **with** an override reason → record a decision (in `decisions_dir`: blocker,
    reason, owner, date), then release as above.
  - `go` while a blocker is open **without** a reason → do not release; ask on the demo issue for the reason.
  - `no-go` or no answer → no release; carry the reason into the next sprint plan.
- After a release or a no-go: back-merge `stage` → `dev` if they diverged (`scripts/pr merge N --method merge
  --ci-only`; if the back-merge has conflicts, resolve them on a `backmerge/*` branch — that PR goes through the
  full review gate, since conflict resolutions are code).

## 3. Roll the sprint
Close the finished milestone; `B sprint create "Sprint NN+1" <demo day + 14>` if missing; unfinished issues move
to it. Comment `<!-- pt-demo-applied -->` with a short list of what was applied on the demo issue, then close it.
