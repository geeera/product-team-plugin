description: Build the sprint demo page — what shipped with stage links and screenshots, QA findings, proposed features and wow proposals each with approve/reject/comment, and the release go/no-go — publish it and send the link to the owner. Used by slot-qa on demo day, or on request.

# Demo prep

`B` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog`. The page is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/demo-page.html`
filled with this sprint's data; never hand-edit its markup per sprint.

## 1. Collect (delegate the text to `pm`, numbers to `analyst`, wow ideas to `ui-designer`)
Write `demo.json` (schema = the example data inside the template):
- `product`, `repo`, `sprint`, `demo_date`, `stage_url`, `demo_issue` (`team:demo` issue; create it if missing).
- `shipped`: issues moved to `done` this sprint and present on `stage` — `id` = `issue-<n>`, one-sentence
  plain-language `summary`, `stage_link` to the exact screen. `screenshot` only as a small data URI (the page
  cannot load images from other hosts); skip it rather than link an external image.
- `findings`: open findings of this sprint with severity and status.
- `proposals`: `status:proposed` features the owner has not decided yet, plus **one `kind:wow` proposal per
  shipped feature** (create the wow issues first) — `summary` and, where available, `evidence`.
- `release`: `recommendation` (`go` only if no open `release-blocker`), `auto_no_go` (a blocker found during the
  freeze), `blockers` list.
- `metrics`: 3–6 figures from `analyst`: `scripts/sprint-metrics` (planned vs shipped, median cycle time,
  QA first-pass rate), `scripts/runlog stats` (runs, failures, minutes), plus Actions minutes and free-tier
  usage where readable.

## 2. Build
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/demo-page build demo.json demo-<sprint>.html`

## 3. Publish
- **Artifact tool available** → publish the file as a new artifact (icon `presentation`, title
  `<Product> <Sprint> Demo`) with
  `capabilities: {db: {rules: [{path: "", read: "view", write: "owner"}]}}` — only the owner's decisions are
  stored. Verify once with `ArtifactData` `list` on `decisions` (empty is expected). Record the artifact URL in
  the demo issue.
- **No Artifact tool** (typical in scheduled cloud runs) → commit nothing; instead write the same content as the
  demo issue body in Markdown: shipped (links), findings, proposals (each links its issue), release
  recommendation. Tell the owner to answer with `/approve` or `/reject why` **on each proposal issue** and
  `/go` or `/no-go why` (or `/override why` when blocked) **on the demo issue**.

## 4. Notify
Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/inbox update`, then `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workflows run owner-digest.yml`
so the release question reaches the phone now, not tomorrow morning.
Comment on the demo issue with the link and the three decisions that matter most. The page's "Copy decisions"
button produces a `/demo-decisions` block the owner can paste there too — both routes are read by `demo-apply`.
