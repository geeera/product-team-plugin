name: hotfix
description: Fix a P0/P1 defect that is live in production between demos — hotfix branch from main, independent QA, release to main without waiting for the demo, back-merge to stage and dev, owner notified after the fact; or roll back when a fix is not quick. Used by slot-dev and slot-qa for issues labelled in-production, or on request.

# Hotfix — production defect

Runs inside the calling slot's run protocol. `B` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog`.
Only for `kind:bug` with `sev:critical` or `sev:high` **and** `in-production`. Everything else waits for the
normal flow. P0/P1 need no approval (SPEC decision 5); the owner is told immediately and may override.

## 1. Decide: fix forward or roll back
Ask `devops` for the last good production release (the previous `main` tag or deploy) and `qa` for the blast
radius (who is affected, is data being damaged).
- **Data loss or security exposure in progress, or no fix within this run** → roll back first (step 4), then fix.
- Otherwise fix forward (steps 2–3).

## 2. Fix
`B move N in-progress`. `fullstack-dev` on `hotfix/<issue>-<slug>` from `main`, PR to `main`.
The PR contains the smallest change that removes the defect plus a regression test that fails without it —
no refactors, no drive-by fixes.

## 3. Gate and release
- CI green **and** `qa` verdict `QA: APPROVED` (independent review, as always; OWASP pass if the defect is
  security-relevant).
- Merge the PR into `main` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr merge <pr> --method squash --delete-branch`); production deploys from `main` through Actions. `devops`
  confirms the deploy finished and the defect is gone on production (e2e smoke or the reproduction steps).
- Tag the release with the project's scheme plus a hotfix suffix (e.g. `v2026.10.02-hotfix.1`).
- Back-merge: PR `main` → `stage`, then `stage` → `dev` (or `main` → `dev` outside a freeze); merge each on
  green CI with `--method merge` (never squash long-lived branches into each other). Conflicts are resolved in the back-merge PR, never by pushing to the branches.
- `B move N done`.

## 4. Roll back
`devops` opens a PR to `main` that reverts the offending merge (`git revert -m 1 <merge sha>` on a branch) or
redeploys the previous tag through the deploy workflow's manual trigger. Same gates: green CI, `qa` verdict.
Record what was rolled back on the issue; the fix then follows steps 2–3.

## 5. Tell the owner
Comment on the issue — GitHub notifies the owner — with: what broke, since when, who was affected, fixed or
rolled back, the PR and the tag, and any follow-up (`kind:finding` for the root cause, planned in the next
sprint). If the defect came from a missing check, the follow-up adds that check.
