name: pause
description: Pause the product team on this repository when the owner says so ("pause development", "давай приостановим разработку", "freeze the team") — switch off its scheduled routines and scheduled workflows, mark the run log paused, and record exactly what was switched off so resume can restore it. Interactive; run in the owner's chat, not from a routine.

# Pause the team

Only on the owner's explicit request in this conversation. `R` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts`.

## 1. Show what will happen and confirm once
Find the repository (`R/backlog sprint current` confirms access and shows the sprint). Collect and show the owner:
- **Routines**: with the `RemoteTrigger` tool, `list`, and keep the routines whose sources include this
  repository's GitHub URL. Show name, schedule, enabled.
- **Scheduled workflows**: `R/workflows list`; the ones that run on a schedule and cost Actions minutes while the
  team is away (typically Renovate). CI, branch guard and deploys stay on — they only run on pushes and PRs.
- **Work in flight**: `R/pr list --base dev` and `R/backlog list --status in-progress`. Say plainly that open PRs
  will go stale while paused; offer to leave them or to close them with a comment.
Ask for one confirmation. Routines cannot be deleted through the API (only on claude.ai/code/routines) — they are
switched off, which stops every run and all quota use, and keeps their schedule and prompt for resume.

## 2. Switch off
1. Each routine that is enabled → `RemoteTrigger` `update` with `{"enabled": false}`. Keep for each: id, name,
   `cron_expression`, model, environment id and the prompt text (from `get`), so it can be re-created if someone
   deletes it in the UI meanwhile.
2. `R/workflows disable <file>...` for the scheduled workflows the owner agreed to.
3. Write the record to a temp file and `R/runlog pause --record-file <file> --reason "<owner's words>"`:
   `{"routines": [{"id", "name", "cron", "model", "environment_id", "prompt", "was_enabled"}], "workflows": [...]}`.
   This labels the run log `team:paused` (any run that still fires does no work) and stores the record.
4. `R/inbox update`.

## 3. Report
One short message: what was switched off, where the record is (run-log link), what stays on, and that "продолжим" /
"resume" brings it back. If any step failed, say which and leave the rest as it is — never half-report success.
