# QA regression on `stage`

Runs inside the calling slot's run protocol. `B` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog`. Stage URL:
`environments.stage.url` in `.product-team/project.yml` (missing → `kind:question` for devops/owner, stop).

1. **Run the suite** — `qa-runner` agent: full `e2e` command with `BASE_URL=<stage url>` on a checkout of `stage`,
   plus the a11y assertions. It reports failures with evidence; no code changes.
2. **Judgement pass** — `qa` agent: failures from step 1 triaged into findings with severity; polish checklist
   (`reference/qa-checklists.md`) on the flows changed this sprint. `security` spot-checks the auth, data and
   payment paths changed this sprint. Security Critical/High and UX blockers get `release-blocker`.
3. **Fix blockers only** — for each `release-blocker` (and P0/P1 bug) in the sprint: the `agent`
   from the issue's `B next` entry (freeze mode: base `stage`, prefix `fix`) on `fix/<issue>-<slug>`, PR to
   `stage`, the usual review gate (`PR gate`; failed rounds labelled as in `slot-qa`: `review-failed`, then
   `tier-up`; `+security` when `PR security-check` requires it), merge with `PR merge --method squash`. Then
   `devops` opens the back-merge PR `stage` → `dev` and merges it with
   `PR merge --method merge --ci-only` when green. No other changes enter `stage`.
4. **Release status** — comment on the sprint's `team:demo` issue: open blockers (links), findings by severity,
   the team's recommendation. Any open `release-blocker` = automatic no-go (the owner may override at the demo
   with a written reason).
