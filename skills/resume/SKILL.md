description: Resume the product team on this repository when the owner says so ("resume development", "продолжим", "unfreeze the team") — switch back on exactly the routines and workflows the last pause switched off, lift the run-log pause, and make sure there is a current sprint to work on. Interactive; run in the owner's chat.

# Resume the team

Only on the owner's explicit request in this conversation. `R` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts`.

## 1. Read what the pause switched off
`R/runlog pause-record` → the active record (`routines`, `workflows`, `reason`, `paused_at`). If it is `null`
there is no owner pause: check `R/runlog status` (maybe an automatic pause after failed runs — then show the failed
runs and resume only with the owner's go) and stop if nothing is paused.

## 2. Check the ground before switching on
- **Sprint**: `R/backlog sprint current`. `null` means every sprint is in the past — propose a new one: title
  `Sprint NN` (next number), demo on a weekday 12–14 days out, and create it with `R/backlog sprint create` after
  the owner agrees (or they give another date). Unfinished issues of the old sprint move to it
  (`R/backlog milestone N "<new sprint>"`).
- **Stale work**: open PRs from before the pause (`R/pr list --base dev`) — they will be brought up to date or
  re-reviewed by the normal slots; mention them.
- **Plugin**: if `.claude/product-team/MANIFEST.json` exists, the first `slot-pm` will self-update as usual.

## 3. Switch on
1. Each routine in the record with `was_enabled: true` → `RemoteTrigger` `update` `{"enabled": true}`. If `get`
   says it no longer exists, re-create it with `create` from the stored name, cron, model, environment and prompt,
   after showing the owner what will be created.
2. `R/workflows enable <file>...` for the workflows in the record.
3. `R/runlog resume` (lifts `team:paused`, records the resume; failures before the pause no longer count).
4. `R/inbox update`.

## 4. Report
What is back on, the next scheduled run time for each routine (from the `update` result), the sprint and its demo
date, and anything that needs the owner.
