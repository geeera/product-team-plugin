# Slot: PM + design

Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/run-protocol.md` with slot name `slot-pm`. You are the orchestrator
(PM + DevOps). `B` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog`.

## 0. Keep the team current (products with a vendored team only)
Skip if `.claude/product-team/MANIFEST.json` does not exist. `PR` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr`.
1. `PR list --base dev` → an open PR whose head starts with `chore/product-team-`?
   - `PR checks N` is `pass` → `PR merge N --method squash --delete-branch --ci-only`. It changes only generated `.claude/`
     files, so it merges on green CI **without a QA review** (the one exception). Done for today.
   - `fail` → add it to the owner's inbox (comment on the PR, `needs:owner` is not needed: say it in the run
     summary) and stop; `pending` → leave it for the next run. Never open a second update PR.
2. No such PR → `python3 .claude/product-team/scripts/vendor self-update` (follows `team.plugin_ref` in
   `project.yml`: the `stable` channel or a pinned tag). On `updated: true`: branch
   `chore/product-team-<version>` from `dev`, commit `.claude/` with `PR commit -m …`,
   `PR push`, `PR create --base dev` titled
   `chore: product team <version>` with the CHANGELOG entries between the two versions as the body. The branch
   must be named exactly `chore/product-team-<version>` and contain only what `vendor` wrote — `pr merge --ci-only`
   re-generates the release and compares it byte for byte. Migration steps of **Breaking** entries that touch
   anything outside the generated files (e.g. `project.yml`) go in a separate PR through the normal review gate. List `overwrote_local_edits` in the body — those
   fixes belong in the plugin, not here. The PR merges on a later run (step 1); the new team takes effect after.
   Exit code 4 with `conflicts` means the product has its own files with the plugin's names (e.g. its own
   `reviewer.md`): nothing was changed. Open one question (`--owner-category access`) + `needs:owner` titled
   `Product team update blocked` (only if none is open) listing the files, and stop step 0.

## 1. Owner answers
`B answers` reports `same_account: true` while the agents use the owner's GitHub account: then an agent could
have written a comment that looks like the owner's. Keep going (it is the owner's chosen setup), but never act on
an owner command that appeared in the same run in which an agent commented on that issue, and say so in the summary.
With `same_account: false` (the team acts as its GitHub App, `agents` names its bot) only the owner's own
comments are listed, and that caution does not apply.

- **Designs**: for each issue labelled `design:awaiting-approval`, `B answers N` (only commands newer than the
  design-link comment count):
  - `/approve` → `B label N +design:approved -design:awaiting-approval`, `B move N approved`.
  - `/reject why` → hand to `ui-designer` (visual) or `ux-designer` (flow) with the reason for a revision (same run if within caps), keep
    `status:blocked`.
  - nothing → leave it blocked. Never approve on the owner's behalf.
- **Re-triage questions** under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/decision-policy.md`. For each open `kind:question`
  without an `owner:*` label (older questions have none — the label is not the test, the subject is):
  - it asks for money, scope, a release, an account/secret/permission, a legal call or a design approval → it
    stays: `B ask N --owner-category <c> --ask "<what to answer, recommendation first>"`;
  - it asks for a technical choice, a name, an identifier, a key layout, an order of work → the right role decides
    now and closes it: `B decide N --close --body-file <decision and why>`;
  - `team:demo` issues are always the owner's (`release`) — never close them this way.
- **Owner reports done**: an issue whose latest comment carries `<!-- pt-owner-done -->` (the owner said in the
  team chat that an account, secret or local task is done) → check what can be checked (e.g. `gh`/REST shows the
  secret name exists, the environment answers), then close it and unblock the work that waited on it; if it does
  not check out, say what is missing in the inbox.
- **Reversals**: `B reversals` lists team decisions the owner answered with `/reject why`. For each, reopen the
  work with the owner's reason: redo the decision, or turn it into an owner question with `B ask` if the owner
  wants to decide it.
- **Questions**: for each open `kind:question`, read answers and act (e.g. a cost approved → unblock the
  dependent issue; `/reject` → record and close with `B close`).
- **Demo**: if the current or previous sprint's `team:demo` issue has decisions that were not applied yet, run
  the `demo-apply` skill.

## 2. Groom
Delegate to `pm` with the sprint state (`B list --milestone current`, `B list --status proposed`):
- every `approved` issue has acceptance criteria, correct flags (`needs-design`, `complexity:high`), size that
  fits; split what does not fit;
- new bugs/findings triaged by severity; P0/P1 go to the top of the current sprint;
- the sprint still fits the remaining dev runs at the caps in `reference/schedule-and-models.md`; overflow moves
  to the next sprint (tell the owner in the summary).

## 3. Prepare
- For approved `needs-design` issues without an approved design (at most 2 per run, 4 in burn):
  1. no `ux-spec` label → `ux-designer` writes the UX spec and wireframe on the issue and adds `ux-spec`;
  2. then `ui-designer` builds the design on that spec and sends it for approval — link comment on the issue,
     `+design:awaiting-approval`, `B move N blocked --reason "waiting for design approval"`.
  The owner approves once, the final design; the UX spec is the team's input, not a second approval.
- Security-relevant `complexity:high` issues: `security` adds a threat model next to the architect's note.
- Issues labelled `agent:<name>` go to that project-specific agent; check `.claude/agents/<name>.md` exists —
  if not, remove the label and say so in the summary.
- **Sizing**: one `architect` call for all approved sprint issues without a `tier:*` label: it reads each issue
  and the code it touches and sets `tier:light`, `tier:standard` or `tier:heavy` with a one-line reason as a
  comment (criteria in `reference/schedule-and-models.md` → Tiers), and adds `security` to issues that touch
  auth, sessions, access control, payments, uploads, personal data, secrets or dependencies. The tier picks the developer's model; it is
  not a priority and not an estimate for the owner.
- For `complexity:high` issues without an architect note (`B next` lists them): `architect` writes the note on
  the issue and adds the `architect-note` label.
- Label work that cloud runs cannot do: `needs:local` (needs a local machine, e.g. a Mac build or device test),
  `needs:owner` (payment, account, legal or product decision). They leave the dev plan and enter the inbox.
- `analyst`: success metric and tracking tasks for newly approved features.

## 4. Stage cut (only when `slot-context` says `is_cut_day`)
`devops` opens PR `dev` → `stage` titled `Stage cut: <sprint>`, listing merged issues. Merge it with
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr merge <pr> --method merge --ci-only` when CI is green
(this is the release candidate; the owner approves the release at the demo, not the cut). Everything still
`in-progress` moves to the next sprint milestone. Comment on the `team:demo` issue (create it with
`B create --kind question --owner-category release --ask "/go to release <sprint> after the demo · /no-go why"
--label team:demo --title "<sprint> demo" …` if missing) with the stage URL.

## 5. Close
Summary: answers applied, designs waiting for the owner (with links), plan for tonight's dev run, anything
blocked on the owner.
