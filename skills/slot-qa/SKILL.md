# Slot: QA + fixes + morning summary

Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/run-protocol.md` with slot name `slot-qa`. `B` =
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backlog`, `PR` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr`.

## 1. Freeze
If `mode == freeze`, run the `qa-regression` skill first (it covers `fix/*` PRs to `stage`), then continue with
step 2 for any PRs to `dev` that are still open.

## 2. Review PRs (`status:qa` issues)
For each linked open PR, oldest first:
1. **Mergeable?** `PR view <pr>` → `merge_state`. `dirty` (conflicts) → the developer agent merges the base into
   the branch locally (no force-push; generated files are regenerated, not hand-merged) and pushes with
   `PR push`; review it in a later slot. `behind` alone is fine — GitHub merges it as is, and updating the branch would make every
   existing verdict stale.
2. `PR checks <pr>` — pending: skip (next slot); red: comment the failing job on the PR,
   `B move N in-progress --reason "CI red: <job>"`, `B label N +qa:changes-requested`.
3. Green → `PR gate <pr>` first: its `required` list and `why` say which verdicts this PR needs under the base
   branch's `review:` policy (`reference/workflow.md` → Review gate). Start **only those** reviewers, **in
   parallel**, each with only `PLUGIN_ROOT=<path>`, repo, PR number, issue number — never the developer's summary
   or transcript:
   - `qa` — acceptance, accessibility, polish (when `QA` is required);
   - `reviewer` — code quality against the project's conventions (when `REVIEW` is required; with
     `reviewer: code` a PR that changes no `code_paths` needs none);
   - `security` — when `SECURITY` is required (`PR security-check <pr>` says `required: true`); then also
     `B label N +security`, so any rework of this issue stays off Fable.
4. Verdicts — `PR gate <pr>` sums them up:
   - `passed: true` → `PR merge <pr> --method squash --delete-branch` (it re-checks the gate: CI plus every
     required verdict, approved on the current head), `B label N -qa:changes-requested`, `B move N done`.
   - any `CHANGES REQUESTED` → apply the **review triage** (`reference/workflow.md`): only a real bug, a real
     vulnerability or an unmet acceptance criterion blocks. File every non-blocking item as a follow-up issue
     (`B create --kind finding` with a severity, or `--kind chore`) linked from the PR. Count the rework rounds
     this PR already had (`review-failed` = one, `tier-up` = two): once they reach `policy.max_rework_rounds` (guidance
     for you — the gate itself does not enforce it)
     from `PR gate`, the PR goes back only while a blocker remains — otherwise ask the reviewer that objected for a
     new verdict on the same head that lists the non-blockers as follow-ups, and merge when the gate passes.
     Going back: `B move N in-progress`, `B label N +qa:changes-requested` (the label stands for
     any reviewer; it puts the issue in the next `B next` plan). First failed round: `B label N +review-failed`;
     a second one: `B label N +tier-up` — the rework then goes to the next tier's developer.
     Whoever does rework is always the `agent` of the issue's entry in `B next`, never a developer picked by hand. If the changes are small and the issue is P0/P1,
     dispatch the `agent` from the issue's `B next` entry now on the same branch, then one more round of the reviewers that asked.
   - a required verdict missing (a reviewer failed) → run that reviewer again next slot; never merge around it.
5. Findings the reviewer filed outside the PR's scope stay in the backlog with their severity.

## 3. Triage
Review new `kind:finding` / `kind:bug` issues since the last run: severity set, `release-blocker` on security
Critical/High and UX blockers, blockers placed in the current sprint (`B move N approved` — no owner approval
needed), Medium in the next sprint, Low in the backlog. A P0/P1 defect that is live in production gets
`in-production` and goes through the `hotfix` skill in this run. Work that needs a local machine or the owner
gets `needs:local` / `needs:owner`.

## 4. Deep audit — Saturday burn slot only
When `slot-context` is `burn` on a Saturday and no deep audit ran this sprint (look for a run-log summary with
"deep audit" in the current sprint), run in parallel:
- `security`: deep audit of the whole `dev` branch (OWASP, dependency audit, secrets in history, authz paths,
  headers on the deployed environments).
- `ux-designer`: UX walkthrough of the key flows on `stage` (or `dev` before the cut); `ui-designer` the visual
  review alongside it.
- `reviewer`: a sweep of code merged this sprint for drift from the conventions.
- `analyst`: sprint metrics for the demo (`scripts/sprint-metrics`, `scripts/runlog stats`).
- `architect` is **not** used for the security part (Fable refusals); it may review debt and structure.
All output becomes findings through `B create`.

## 5. Demo day
If today is the sprint's demo date (`slot-context.demo_date`), run the `demo-prep` skill after the reviews.

## 6. Morning summary
Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/inbox update` first — the pinned "Needs you" issue is the owner's to-do list.
Hand the facts to the `scribe` agent to format; post it as the run summary (run-log comment) and print it. It
contains, in this order:
1. **Needs you** — the count from the inbox and its link (the details live there, not in the summary).
2. Shipped to `dev` overnight (issue → PR).
3. Blockers and P0/P1 status.
4. What the team does next.
Keep it readable on a phone: no tables wider than three columns, no internal jargon.
